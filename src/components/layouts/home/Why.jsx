      <h1>Why XFI?</h1>
      <p>
        Traditional social platforms don’t make it easy to support creators,
        send funds globally, or connect communities financially. Payments are
        often slow, costly, and limited by borders.
      </p>

      <p>
        With XFI, tipping becomes instant, borderless, and transparent. Powered
        by Solana, XFI lets you support creators on X (Twitter), swap tokens
        seamlessly, and attach messages to your tips — all with minimal fees and
        no middlemen.
      </p>

      <p>
        Whether you’re a creator seeking global support or a fan wanting to show
        appreciation, XFI makes value transfer as easy as liking a post, but
        with real impact.
      </p>
